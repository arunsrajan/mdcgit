We must explicitly import them\n   if native_format == 'BigInteger':\n     element.requires_imports.append('java.math.BigInteger')\n   elif native_format == 'DateTime':\n     element.requires_imports.append('com.google.api.client.util.DateTime')\n\nHere's another example:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-apis-client-generator/source/browse/src/googleap\nis/codegen/java/default/templates/___package___/ApiClient.java.tmpl\n\ncopied below:\n\n{% if api.dataWrapper %}\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent;\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCParser;\n{% endif %}\n\n\nHere's what we did in the GData code generator that I found very effective: \nevery time you use a Java class you call \nuse(\"com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent\").  It automatically \ntracks all of the \"extraImports\" this way, and so you never have write any \nexplicit import statements in your templates.  If that section of generation \nisn't called, use() is never called.  So you don't need to duplicate your \nif-logic between the code section and the import section.  It also takes care \nof other logic like determining if there is a collision between two classes and \ntherefore decide when to use just the class name or a fully-qualified class \nname.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 3:31"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76558893","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303#issuecomment-76558893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303","id":76558893,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","body":"```\nThis issue was reported internally by yanivi@google.com\n```\n\nOriginal comment by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 5:42"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z"}

We must explicitly import them\n   if native_format == 'BigInteger':\n     element.requires_imports.append('java.math.BigInteger')\n   elif native_format == 'DateTime':\n     element.requires_imports.append('com.google.api.client.util.DateTime')\n\nHere's another example:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-apis-client-generator/source/browse/src/googleap\nis/codegen/java/default/templates/___package___/ApiClient.java.tmpl\n\ncopied below:\n\n{% if api.dataWrapper %}\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent;\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCParser;\n{% endif %}\n\n\nHere's what we did in the GData code generator that I found very effective: \nevery time you use a Java class you call \nuse(\"com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent\").  It automatically \ntracks all of the \"extraImports\" this way, and so you never have write any \nexplicit import statements in your templates.  If that section of generation \nisn't called, use() is never called.  So you don't need to duplicate your \nif-logic between the code section and the import section.  It also takes care \nof other logic like determining if there is a collision between two classes and \ntherefore decide when to use just the class name or a fully-qualified class \nname.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 3:31"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76558898","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303#issuecomment-76558898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303","id":76558898,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","body":"\n\nOriginal comment by `yan...@google.com` on 7 Nov 2011 at 5:37\n* Added labels: **Priority-Low**\n* Removed labels: **Priority-Medium**"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z"}

But then I also want some kind of RemoteRequestInitializer interface \nthat works just like HttpRequestInitializer that allows any parameter in \nRemoteRequest to be initialized the same across all RemoteRequests.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 3:48"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76558910","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/305#issuecomment-76558910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/305","id":76558910,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:05Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:05Z","body":"\n\nOriginal comment by `yan...@google.com` on 7 Nov 2011 at 5:36\n* Added labels: **Priority-High**\n* Removed labels: **Priority-Medium**"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:05Z"}

This has \nreturned results ok and displayed them in my Android app until about 9 days \nago. Now the query returns with a JSON result but the value for the \n'totalResults' field is of type string rather than number (i.e. it now returns \n\"185000\", but used to return 185000) and as a result an \nIllegalArgumentException is thrown when the JSON parser tries to convert the \n\"185000\" to the expected type of number. I checked the source code for \ngoogle-api-services-customsearch-v1-1.2.2-beta and in Query.java the \"private \nInteger totalResults\" field is marked with the annotation \n\"@Key(\"totalResults\")\" - see line 217. I assume this should now be \"private \nString totalResults\".\n\nI manually entered my query in a browser, having replaced MY_APP_KEY with my \napp key and MY_CSE_ID with my custom search engine identifier:\n\n\"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=MY_APP_KEY&cx=MY_CSE_ID&q=the+on\nly+problem&alt=json\"\n\nand it returns this (top and bottom ommitted for clarity but you can run the \nquery yourself and see):\n\n\"queries\": {\n  \"nextPage\": [\n   {\n    \"title\": \"Google Custom Search - the only problem\",\n    \"totalResults\": \"185000\",\n \nThe 'totalResults' field is now a string.
